# Day2
This is the Tip Calculator🧮. Sounds simple? Believe you me, my biological CPU🧠 overclocked🤯. Well its true that No Pain No Gain💪
On day 2 I've learned various Python Premetive Data Types,
Methametical operations,
The number manipulationd and F string. I must say that the F string is F*ing life saviour😉.
PEMDAS basically means that Python will give methametical priorities according to PEDMAS, full form:
•Parentheses () 
•Exponent ** 
•Multiplication * ✖️
•Division / ➗
•Addition + ➕
•Subtraction - ➖
*Also python start maths from left-to-right. 
*Multiplication and division has a same value or priorities or both stands equal,
same logic applies to Addition and Subtration.
